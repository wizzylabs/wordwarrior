	  <h3>8. Binding arbitration / Class waiver</h3>

	  <p><strong style="font-weight:600">If you are a United States resident or otherwise make any claim against Wizzy Labs in the United States, you expressly agree that any legal claim, dispute or other controversy between you and Wizzy Labs arising out of or otherwise relating in any way to Services, including controversies relating to the applicability, enforceability or validity of any provision of these TOS or Wizzy Labs´ Privacy Policy (collectively "Disputes"), shall be resolved in confidential binding arbitration conducted before one commercial arbitrator from the American Arbitration Association ("AAA"), rather than in a court, as described herein. The arbitration will be governed by the AAA's commercial arbitration rules and, if the arbitrator deems them applicable, the supplementary procedures for consumer related disputes (collectively "Rules and Procedures"). You acknowledge that you are voluntarily and knowingly forfeiting your right to a trial by jury and to otherwise proceed in a lawsuit in state or federal court.</strong></p>

	  <p>Payment of arbitration costs will be governed by the AAA's fee schedule, unless you are able to show that your portion will be prohibitive as compared to litigation costs, in which case Wizzy Labs will pay as much of your arbitration costs as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive as compared to litigation costs. Wizzy Labs also reserves the right in its sole and exclusive discretion to assume responsibility for all arbitration costs imposed by the AAA. Each party agrees to pay its own attorneys' fees and expenses unless there is a governing statutory provision that requires the prevailing party to be paid attorneys' fees and expenses.</p>

	  <p>The arbitration may be conducted in Los Angeles, California or, upon your request, in the city closest to you location where AAA maintains an office. The arbitrator's award shall be final and binding on you and Wizzy Labs and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction.</p>

	  <p>For more information on AAA, its Rules and Procedures, and how to file an arbitration claim, you may call AAA at 800-778-7879 or visit the AAA website at <a href="http://www.adr.org">www.adr.org</a>.</p>

	  <p>As an exception to the binding arbitration rule, to the extent the Dispute arises from:</p>

	  <ol><li>A violation of Wizzy Labs´ intellectual property rights in any manner;</li>
		  <li>Any claim related to, or arising from, allegations of theft, piracy, unauthorized use or a violation of the United States Computer Fraud and Abuse Act or Section “Code of conduct” of these TOS; and</li>
		  <li>Any claim for equitable relief;</li>
	  </ol><p>then both parties agree that a party may seek injunctive remedies (or an equivalent type of urgent legal relief) in any court with jurisdiction over the other party. In addition to the foregoing, either party may assert an individual action in small claims court for Claims that are within the scope of such court's jurisdiction in lieu of arbitration.</p>

	  <p>To the extent permissible under applicable law, all Disputes shall be resolved by binding confidential arbitration on an individual basis. You expressly agree that no other Disputes shall be consolidated or joined with your Dispute, whether through class arbitration proceedings or otherwise.  <strong style="font-weight:600">You and Wizzy Labs agree that there is no right or authority for any dispute to be arbitrated on a class-action basis or to utilize class action procedures, there is no right or authority for any dispute to be brought in a purported representative capacity or as a private attorney general, and no arbitration shall be joined with any other arbitration.</strong></p>

	  <p>You may opt out of this obligation to arbitrate. If you do so, neither you nor Wizzy Labs can require the other to participate in an arbitration proceeding. To opt out, you must notify Wizzy Labs in writing within 30 days of the date that you first became subject to this arbitration provision. You must use this address to opt out: Wizzy Labs LLC, ATTN: Legal Department, Yenimahalle, Ankara, Turkey. You must include your name and residence address and a clear statement that you want to opt out of this arbitration clause.</p>

	  <p>To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter to: Wizzy Labs LLC, ATTN: Legal Department, Yenimahalle, Ankara, Turkey requesting arbitration and describing your claim.</p>

	  <p>Wizzy Labs will provide 30-days’ notice of any changes to this Section “Binding arbitration/ Class waiver” through the Services or via other similar means. Changes will become effective on the 30th day and will apply prospectively only to any claims arising after the 30th day.</p>

	  <h3>9. Suspension and Termination for your Breach</h3>

	  <p>Without limiting any other remedies available to Wizzy Labs, if Wizzy Labs believes that you are in breach of these TOS, Wizzy Labs reserves the right to take any of the following actions, whether individually or in combination, and either with or without notice to you: (i) delete, suspend and/or modify your Account or parts of your Account; (ii) limit, suspend and/or terminate your access to the Services; (iii) modify and/or remove any of your Virtual Items; (iv) reset and/or modify any game progression or benefits and privileges associated with you, such as any level or score you have reached in the Services.</p>

	  <h3>10. Availability of the Services</h3>

	  <p>Wizzy Labs may limit, suspend or terminate the Services, or portions thereof, and take technical and legal steps to prevent users from accessing the Services if Wizzy Labs believes they are creating risk or possible legal liabilities, infringing intellectual property rights of third parties, or not acting in accordance with the letter or spirit of these TOS.</p>

	  <p>Wizzy Labs reserves the right to stop offering and/or supporting the Services or a part thereof (<em>e.g</em>. a game or a feature of a game) at any time, at which point your license to use the Services or a part thereof will be terminated automatically. <strong style="font-weight:600">In such an event, unless otherwise required by applicable law, Wizzy Labs does not have to provide refunds for Virtual Items or other items in connection with such discontinued Services.</strong></p>
